Memory allocation and Deallocation happens automatically
Memory Mangement
----------------
new()
1. Allocate memory but no INIT
2. You will get a memory address
3. Zeroed Storage

make()
1. Allocate memory and INIT
2. You will get a memory address
3. Non-zeroed storage

 
1. Garbae collection happens automatically - threshold values about the memory
2. Out of Scope or nil

GOGC - variable sets the inital garbage collection target percentage and GC happens after that value is reached.
