Need of new Language:
Python - easy to use but SLOW.
Java - quick but tyoe system complexity.
C/C++ - quick, compile time slow.

Multi-threaded was not present before and concurrency patched in at best in them. So, challenging with hihgly parallel.

ADVANTAGES
1. Strong - we cannot change the type of the variable
2. Statically typed - defiine at complie time. 
3. Excellent Community
4. Key features - 
    Simplicity - 
    Fast Compile times
    Garbage collected - dont need to manage own memory
    Build-in concurrency
    Compile to standalone library - when compile then everything is going to be buundled into that single binary that's related to the go application.
