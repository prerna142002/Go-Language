Why pointers exist
1. Problem - declare a variable, constant or anything are referecne of the memory
When passed to function then we pass the copy instead of the variable and create irregularities.
Pointers gives the assurity - passing memeory address - passing actual variable. 
To absolute assurance we need to make sure that we pass the actual value and not the copy we use the pointers.
Direct reference to the memory address.
